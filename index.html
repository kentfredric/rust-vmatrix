    <p>This is a tiny<span class="hint" title="lol, well, not in terms of resources needed">*</span>
       project to map what you get when you try to compile given
       versions of given crates against given rustc versions.</p>
    <p>The Objective is to properly map out some sense of
       <em>practical</em> <strong class="hint" title="Minimal Supported Rust Version">MSRV</strong>
       to consider when trying to yourself declare a <strong>MSRV</strong>,
       and pick dependencies based on <strong>MSRV</strong> support,
       and/or, trying to find version combinations that "<em>work</em>"
       when building an arbitrary crate on an arbitray rust
       target.</p>
    <p>It is in <em>no</em> way comprehensive, and is just a
       <em>minimal best effort</em> strategy to narrow down your
       problem quickly.</p>
    <h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1>
    <p>The approach I've used is so simple, it could be called
       "<em>rudimentary</em>".</p>
    <p>For each <code>rustc</code>, and for each <code>crate</code>
       version, construct a dummy project layout that depends on an
       exact version of that, and see if it compiles</p>
    <code><pre># $tmpdir/Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "test"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Kent Fredric &lt;kentnl@gentoo.org&gt;"]

[dependencies.CRATENAME]
version = "=VERSION"
# $tmpdir/src/lib.rs
# *empty file*
</pre></code>
    <p><strong>Note</strong> that it doesn't even think about
       features, and if there are second-order dependencies that
       just <strong>happen</strong> to get pulled in, and
       <em>happen</em> to themselves be broken, then this scenario
       reports a <strong>false negative</strong>.</p>
    <p>It also reports <strong>false negatives</strong> when
       dependencies don't strictly follow semver, and break API,
       leading to compile failures (and also when dependencies are
       not sufficiently semver-binding).</p>
    <p>It is also somewhat subject to <strong>passes</strong> being
       eventually downgraded to <strong>failures</strong>, if the
       version of the dependency used in the test worked at the time,
       but a future version breaks either <strong>MSRV</strong> or
       <strong>API</strong> and otherwise circumvents semver
       bindings.</p>
    <p>It is in some casess possible to work around these situations
       through careful package selection, and some data about that
       somewhere is also on a whishlist for when I have some clue how
       to do such a thing.</p>
    <p><strong>Notedly</strong>, these risks are why I've prioritized
       getting coverage of <em>fundamental</em> crates, particularly,
       ones with either few, or no dependencies, or at least,
       recursively checking the dependencies themselves.</p>
